# AnnotatedBibliography
This is an annotated bibliography template in Latex. It is a simple edit on the plain-annote.bst file. (http://math.ucdenver.edu/~billups/courses/ma5490/plain-annote.bst) file.
All I have done is take away the code specifying the order of references (it was alphabetical before). 
Now it is in the order of the bibtex file, or the order of citations, which I found more useful.
